# lib

A lightweight collection of reusable components, utilities, and small demo modules created during my blockchain learning journey.

## About This Repository
This repository serves as a personal learning playground.  
It includes:
- Small tools to support blockchain development
- Implementations of key cryptographic primitives
- Simple demos for exploring decentralized systems concepts
- Reusable helper functions and utility scripts

The goal is to **accumulate useful code fragments** and **solidify understanding through hands-on practice**.
